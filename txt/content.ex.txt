Create a lighthearted, sassy message that playfully roasts someone's social media presence and their attempts to stay relevant in 2025. Reference:
- Their questionable TikTok dance attempts using neural-enhanced filters
- Their desperate attempts to make "retro" 2020 trends happen again
- Their overuse of AI-generated content and quantum filters
- Their struggle with the new holographic Instagram poses
- Their "camp" aesthetic that's giving very much outdated energy
- Their attempts to go viral on brain-linked social feeds

Keep it Gen Z style with modern slang, sparkle emojis, and "material girl" energy. Make it sound like that one friend who's supportive but also loves to point out how chronically online everyone is. Include references to current tech trends like neural sharing and quantum social media, but make it sound like they're failing at using them. Avoid any pandemic references or old memes. Focus on 2025 culture fails and social media struggles. Keep it playful and camp, with a dash of "yas queen" energy gone wrong.
