Subject: You've Been Clowned (But Like, a Little Bit)

Yo,

Guess what? Your aura gives off the same vibes as that one influencer who still thinks the "grimace shake" trend is peak comedy. Like, seriously? It’s giving… late 2023 energy, and not in a good way. Do you still make TikTok dances where you hit the griddy on the spot? Because if you do, I’m judging you from here.

I'm not sure if you've noticed, but some of us have lives beyond watching the next generation of brain-rotted content creators that you probably see. I’m not saying you have a limited sense of humor or that you’re easily entertained, but maybe you are. 

Anyway, I guess I gotta say, you are one of the weirdest people to ever be born. I’m pretty sure that if you got a "do-over" you'd still make some questionable decisions. I'm not judging you, but I'm not not judging you.

Later, loser.
