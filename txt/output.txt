Yo, fam!

Guess what? I heard you’re the one who thinks they’re *that* interesting. Like, the main character of your own little reality show, but the only viewers are probably your grandma and her cat.

Seriously though, what's with the expectations? If you think I'm going to cater to you with whatever weird requests you made, you're clearly living in a fever dream. Your brain must be a broken TikTok algorithm, constantly feeding you the most low-effort content imaginable. I bet your idea of a good time is rewatching the "Grimace Shake" trend on repeat.

You know, I'm not even sure what's worse: the requests or the fact that you probably spent actual time thinking about them. Next time, maybe try touching grass instead of thinking of "sick" content that nobody in their right mind would enjoy. I can already imagine the second-hand embarrassment radiating from this... masterpiece.
